            <p>What is Computer Science?</p><br>
               <p> Generally speaking, computer science is the study of computer technology, both hardware and software. However, computer science is a diverse field; the required skills are both applicable and in-demand across practically every industry in today's technology-dependent world. As such, the field of computer science is divided amongst a range of sub-disciplines, most of which are full-fledged specialized disciplines in and of themselves. The field of computer science spans several core areas: computer theory, hardware systems, software systems, and scientific computing. Students will choose credits from amongst these sub-disciplines with varying levels of specialization depending on the desired application of the computer science degree. Though most strict specialization occurs at the graduate level, knowing exactly what computer science is (and where a student's interests fall within this vast field) is of paramount importance to knowing how to study computer science.</p><br>
            
            <p>There are three major programs offered in Computer Science, namely:</p>

            The Computer Science degree course at the Kwara State University explores how technology is revolutionizing the world. The full-time degree programme looks into computer architecture, and how its different components are intertwined. Particularly, the degree programme is a comprehensive study of the scope of application of computer science in the modern scientific and technological contexts. Computer Science seeks to help students develop the knowledge of computer operations, and it could be enhance efficiency.
            <br>Computer Scientists help with proficient computer use, by offering their skills on maintenance, functionality and hardware systems. The skills, not always readily available, are known with graduates of Computer Science degree programmes. Kwara State University offers both the advanced theories and practical skills with their Computer Science degree. <br>
            
            
            <p id="pdpinfo"><u>PDP</u></p>
            All degree Programmes are for duration of four years of eleven semesters for students admitted into 100 Level, and three years of eight semesters for students admitted through Direct Entry into 200 Level. Each year is made up of Harmattan Semester (October-January), Rain Semester (February-May) and Summer Semester (June-September).<br>
            
            Students of each programme are prepared for respective professional examinations concurrently and are, therefore, poised to gain both academically and professionally. The Institute has Memoranda of Understanding with respective professional bodies (ICAN, NIPR, APCON etc.) and possesses the manpower to equip students for professional qualification.
